# 13. Stateful sets

1. `app-go` Deployment was changed to the StatefulSet.
2.  Dynamically provisioned by Minikube default storage class PersistentVolume and PersistentVolumeClaim were created for `app-go` application using `volumeClaimTemplates`  


```bash
kubectl get po,sts,svc,pvc
NAME           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/app-go-0   1/1     Running   0          8m25s
pod/app-go-1   1/1     Running   0          8m23s

NAME                      READY   AGE
statefulset.apps/app-go   2/2     8m25s

NAME                 TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
service/app-go       NodePort    10.101.215.37   <none>        8080:30967/TCP   8m25s
service/kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.96.0.1       <none>        443/TCP          4d19h

NAME                                         STATUS   VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS   AGE
persistentvolumeclaim/app-go-data-app-go-0   Bound    pvc-1f19a15e-0844-4f3f-8524-05590ff16758   5Mi        RWO            standard       42m
persistentvolumeclaim/app-go-data-app-go-1   Bound    pvc-f12599d6-9f80-4b28-b927-1a3a85af75c1   5Mi        RWO            standard       8m23s
```


3. Repetitively access the application and check the number of visits


- Ephemeral container for `pod/app-go-0`
```
cat /proc/1/root/app/data/visits.txt
38
```

- Ephemeral container for `pod/app-go-1`
```
cat /proc/1/root/app/data/visits.txt
25
```

As we can see, the number of visits for each pod is different since each pod has it's own persistent volume and requests are distributed between pods performed by LoadBalancer. 


4. Ordering guarantees are unnecesarry for `app-go` (`goredirector`) because all replicas are independent from each other and able to function on their own

5. Implement a way to instruct the StatefulSet controller to launch or terminate all Pods in parallel.


- Parallel pod management policy can be set in `values.yaml` in order to launch or terminate pods in parallel

```
PodManagementPolicy: Parallel
```


## Bonus

- The main steps were applied to the second app

### Update strategies

- In the context of StatefulSets, Kubernetes has two update strategies - `OnDelete` and `RollingUpdate` which can be 
configured in `.spec.updateStrategy.type` and control how pods should be updated upon change of 
various configuration values, such as labels or resource limits.  
    - OnDelete - updates pod only after it is manually deleted. 
    - RollingUpdate - performs ordered deletion and subsequent recreation with updated values
