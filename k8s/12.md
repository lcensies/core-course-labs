## Persistence with files


- In order to save the number of visits the following functions were implenented


```python
# Ensure that file exists and try to fetch the number of visits from it
def configure_visits(app):
    global visits_count
    try:
        vists_path = Path(config["VISITS_PATH"])
        vists_path.parent.mkdir(exist_ok=True, parents=True)
        vists_path.touch(exist_ok=True)
        
        if os.path.getsize(vists_path) > 0:
            with open(vists_path) as f:
                visits_count = int(str(f.read()))

    except Exception as e:
        app.logger.error(f"Failed to read app visits from file: {e}")


def increment_visits():
    global visits_count
    visits_count += 1
    
    with open(config["VISITS_PATH"], "w") as f:
        f.write(str(visits_count))
```


- `docker-compose` Ansible template was updated to include data volume
```yaml
---


version: "3.5"

services:
  {{ web_app_name }}:
    image: {{ web_app_container_image }}
    ports:
      - {{ web_app_port_host }}:{{ web_app_port_docker }}
    volumes:
      - {{ web_app_name }}-data:{{ web_app_data_container_path }}
  

volumes:
  {{ web_app_name }}_data:
    
```

- Visiting the application and checking `/visits` route shows that the number of visits has been incremented

## Mounted configs

- Configmap fetching contents of `config.json` was added

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name:  app-go-config
data:
  config.json: |
    {{ .Files.Get "files/config.json" | indent 4 }}
```


- Volume referencing configmap and VolumeMount were added 
```yaml
# Additional volumes on the output Deployment definition.
volumes:  
  - name: config-volume
    configMap:
      name: app-go-config 

# Additional volumeMounts on the output Deployment definition.
volumeMounts: 
  - name: config-volume
    mountPath: /app/config.json
    subPath: config.json


```

- Since out container doesn't have `tar` or `cat` utilities in it, we had to use ephemeral container with  `kubectl debug` to ensure that volumes were mounted properly.

## Bonus


### Persistence logic

- `IncrementVisits` function is called before redirecting user to the requested page
- `VisitsRequestHandler` route is responsible for showing the number of times the application
has been visited

```go
var visits int = 0

func IncrementVisits(c *gin.Context) error {

	visitsPath := utils.GetEnv("VISITS_PATH", "/app/data/visits.txt")
	f, err := os.OpenFile(visitsPath, os.O_RDWR|os.O_CREATE, 0600)
	if err != nil {

		return err
	}
	defer f.Close()

	if visits == 0 {
		scanner := bufio.NewScanner(f)
		scanner.Scan()

		visits, err = strconv.Atoi(scanner.Text())
		if err != nil {
			visits = 0
		}
	}

	visits += 1

	f.Truncate(0)
	f.Seek(0, 0)
	f.WriteString(strconv.Itoa(visits))

	return nil
}

// Shows the number of times the application
// has been visited
func VisitsRequestHandler(c *gin.Context) {
	c.Data(http.StatusOK, "text/html; charset=UTF-8", []byte(strconv.Itoa(visits)))
}


```

### Environmental variables via configmap

- dedicated `env-configmap.yaml` was added to inject environmental variables to the application
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name:  "app-go-envconfig"
  namespace: default
data:
  DEFAULT_REDIRECT_URL: https://google.com


```

- Reference created configmap from the deployment template:
```yaml
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: {{ .Chart.Name }}
          envFrom:
            - configMapRef:
                name: "app-go-envconfig"
```




- Environmental variables were successfully set up via configMap according to [documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/). However, printing them might not always be straightforward.
    - Since in production containers usually do not have shells or utilities like `printenv`, variable can not be obtained via command suggested in the task description
    - Ephemeral containers are usually used via `kubectl debug` to troubleshoot pod-specific issues, however they do not include container-specific environmental variables
    - `kubectl describe` can be used to view environmental variables, however it does not include those injected from the configMap
    - Another option is to temporarily include debug utilities to the container, however this option would either require additonal setitng of debug tag and reconfiguration.  
    

- Due to aforementioned problems, in order to ensure that the environmental variables were injected properly,
we can verify application-specific login dependent on them. Since out bonus application is responsible for redirecting user to the requested page, we can change the  `DEFAULT_REDIRECT_URL` to  `https://google.com` and
ensure that the request has been redirected to desired destination.
